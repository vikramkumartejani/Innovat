						Innovat is a leading global fund manager with a singular investment
						process designed to identify and invest in disruptive innovation
						that has the potential to create long-term value for our clients.
						Our process focuses on researching, analyzing, and assessing
						companies that are developing new technologies, products, or
						services that have the potential to disrupt existing markets or
						create entirely new ones.
					</p>

					<div>
						<h5 className="fs-20 fw-700">Research and Analysis</h5>
						<p>
							We begin our process by researching and analyzing a wide range of
							industries and markets to identify areas of potential disruption.
							We look for companies that are developing innovative solutions to
							existing problems or creating entirely new products or services.
							We also look for companies that have strong management teams, a
							clear vision, and a competitive advantage in their respective
							markets.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h5 className="fs-20 fw-700">Assessment</h5>
						<p>
							Once we have identified potential investments, we conduct an
							in-depth analysis of each company&apos;s financials, competitive
							landscape, and market opportunity. This includes evaluating the
							company&apos;s financial performance, competitive positioning,
							customer base, product roadmap, and other factors. We also
							consider the company&apos;s management team and their ability to
							execute on their vision.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h5 className="fs-20 fw-700">Due Diligence</h5>
						<p>
							Once we have identified a potential investment opportunity, we
							conduct due diligence on the company&apos;s operations and
							financials. This includes reviewing the company&apos;s financial
							statements as well as conducting interviews with key personnel at
							the company. We also review any relevant legal documents such as
							contracts or agreements with customers or suppliers.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h5 className="fs-20 fw-700">Investment Decision</h5>
						<p>
							Finally, we make an investment decision based on our analysis of
							the company&apos;s fundamentals as well as our assessment of its
							long-term prospects for success. Our goal is to invest in
							companies that have strong fundamentals and a clear path to
							success over the long term.
